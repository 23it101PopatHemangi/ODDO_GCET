### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher) or MongoDB Atlas
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dayflow-hrms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install

   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dayflow-hrms
   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

   For MongoDB Atlas, use:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dayflow-hrms
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   
   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system. If using MongoDB Compass, ensure it's connected to `mongodb://localhost:27017`

5. **Run the application**
   
   From the root directory:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This will start both the server (port 5000) and client (port 3000) concurrently.

   Or run them separately:
   
   **Terminal 1 (Server):**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   **Terminal 2 (Client):**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Default Access

After starting the application:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Register a new account with role "admin" or "hr" for full access
3. Or register as "employee" for limited access
